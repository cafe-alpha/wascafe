/* ---------------
 * --- Outline ---
 *
 * Address aliasing allows redirection of STM32 physical address and/or
 * application-specific features to user-defined (aliased) address.
 *
 * It can be accessed from MAX10 by using memory (or register) access commands :
 *  - WL_SPICMD_MEMREAD
 *  - WL_SPICMD_MEMWRITE
 *
 * Main purpose of this alias feature is to provide shortcuts to several STM32
 * from same commands from MAX10.
 *
 * This has the advantage to relieve code complexity on MAX10 side, which is
 * an important point since onchip memory (where NIOS programs is running) is
 * quite limited.
 * Additionally, this also allow complex STM32 operations in a single memory
 * access from MAX10, thus simplifying SPI transfer flow and consequently
 * improve application performance.
